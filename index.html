    <br><br><u>What is the software development process?</u><br><br>
    The software development process is the process through which a client’s requirements are gathered, analyzed, and turned into a functional piece of software. It starts with the requirements-gathering stage, in which the software developer works closely with the client in order to create a list of requirements that the software must meet, as well as features that the client would like incorporated but are not necessarily required. This stage helps the developer understand the problem that their software is intended to solve. The next stage is the design stage, in which the developer, usually with a team, works to create a plan to meet all of the requirements gathered in the previous step of the process. This step includes using design documents to plan out all possible solutions and decide which one is the most effective. The final stage of the design process is implementation and testing, where the design team works to create a functional piece of software to deliver to the client. This stage includes rigorous testing to ensure the software meets all requirements laid out by the client.
    <br><br><br><u>Why is software design important?</u><br><br>
    Software design is important because it encompasses the entire development process, from client interaction to the planning of a solution to the creation of a piece of software. It is an essential aspect of computer science that is sometimes less talked about, yet arguably the gathering of requirements and planning of a program are as important, if not more, than the creation of the program itself. This is because, without a clear idea of what is required and a plan for how to achieve those requirements, the resulting program will be sloppy and will not properly solve the client’s problem.
    <br><br><br><u>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why.</u><br><br>
    An example of software that I use daily that I believe was designed well is Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a code editor designed for Mac, Linux, and Windows. I believe it is designed extremely well, as it perfectly blends the fact that it is simple and easy to use with its customizability and powerful plugins. The user-friendly UI is simple, and navigation between pages is easy and streamlined. It has many customizable features that make it good for many different purposes. It is clearly designed with the needs of users in mind and continues to be one of my favorite pieces of software.

        <br><br><u>What is the requirements gathering stage?</u><br><br>
        The requirements-gathering stage is the first stage in the software design process. It involves being in close contact with the client about what they require from the product. The goal is to formulate a set of requirements based on the needs of the intended users. This stage often includes interviewing the client about the features that they expect and then taking that information and creating a clear list of requirements that can be used to create a functional program. The requirements-gathering stage is crucial because it lays out the entire basis for the rest of the software design process and provides a starting place for the formation of a product that meets all the client's needs.
        <br><br><br><u>User stories for VS Code</u>
        <br><br>-As a professional working for a software design firm, I want a program that is powerful enough to handle large-scale projects so that I can use this software for my work.
        <br><br>-As a beginner in programming, I want a UI that is intuitive and easy to navigate so that I do not get lost and confused by the software and so that I can focus on learning a new language.
        <br><br>-As a person who uses multiple programming languages, I want a program that is capable of easily swapping between languages so that I do not need to use different software for different languages.
        <br><br>-As an advanced programmer, I want built-in plugins to customize my experience so that I can make my workspace more advanced as my skills improve.
        <br><br>-As someone who has trouble differentiating similar colours due to colorblindness, I want different colour profiles for my coding environment so that I can differentiate between different aspects of my code.

        <br><br><u>Elements of empathy.</u><br><br>
        Empathy is a topic that is important in many situations, and the design process is one such situation. The main focus of the chapter on empathy in Subject to Change is that empathy is a way of understanding consumers. This can be applied specifically to software design in various ways. In order to create good software, the designer or design team must deeply understand the user and their needs; otherwise, the software product will not be effective. The designer must take into consideration the aspects of empathy that are mentioned in the reading, namely knowing the feelings and thoughts of the user as well as the culture and context surrounding the product. Understanding all of these factors that go beyond the numbers allows the designer to grasp the more human side of behavior that is difficult to understand with only tests and statistics.
        <br><br><br><u>Old business models and their flaws, plus the elements of empathy they lack</u>
        <br><br>The Consumers Literally model<br>In this model, the consumer is seen as only a means to gain profit and not as an actual human being. This fosters a division between the designer and the user, which means that by definition there is a lack of empathy because there is no understanding of emotion, and therefore the resulting product is not tailored to the user's needs but rather to what will sell the most and gain the most profit.
        <br><br>The Sheep Model<br>In this model, the user is seen as something to be analyzed and manipulated accordingly. This means that often there is more focus on creating an idea of the product than actually creating a product based on what the user needs. This means that there is an inherent lack of empathy when a designer does not attempt to understand the client but rather learns how to manipulate them in order to make more profit.
        <br><br>The Human Factor Model<br>In this model, the client or consumer is analyzed to create a statistical profile based on how they behave. However, this assumes that humans are like computers, taking inputs and then outputing the most efficient output. This lacks empathy in the sense that one of the key aspects of empathy is to understand the emotion that drives humans to do what they do, and this model completely ignores that and reduces the user to their most likely actions.

<u>Prototyping in Software design</u><br>
Prototyping in Software design is a process through which the designers create preliminary plans for a product before features are finalized. Its main use is to verify the design’s functionality and purpose before the proposed features are implemented into the product. Prototyping plays a key role in the software design process because it helps teams work together to have a collective understanding of the key requirements and how each proposed feature will address those requirements. It is also very useful to identify and address potential issues in the design before resources are spent creating a faulty product. Prototyping can also allow developers to seek feedback from the client and or intended users through usability studies which gives a good idea of the intention behind the design without investing in making it fully functional.
<br><br>
<u>Three Benefits of Prototyping</u>
First, it saves resources in the long term. Although it may seem as if prototyping is not important, or an unnecessary investment of resources, it actually saves time and money in the long run because fewer errors are made and therefore fewer resources are spent correcting those errors. Second, it is a way for teams to work together more effectively because prototypes can be used to communicate ideas between team members and create clarity around the intended function of aspects of the product. And finally, it engages potential users in order to gain feedback directly from the people who will end up using the product prior to creating the final version. 
<br><br>
<u>Paper Prototyping</u>
In paper prototyping, the main steps include: Determining typical tasks, where the developers determine how the product will be used by an everyday user. This step is followed by the actual design of different interfaces and functionalities using paper, which is in turn followed by conducting usability tests and adjusting aspects that require revision.

            <u>Communication in Software Design.</u><br>
            Communication is a very important aspect of the software design process, and it has many benefits that will result in a better overall product design. Likewise, inefficient communication risks wasting time and money on designs that do not meet the client’s expectations. Effective communication comes into play with both gathering requirements from the client as well as communicating within a team environment to create an effective solution for the given task.   
            <br><br>
            <u>Key Elements of Effective Communication.</u><br>
            Effective communication can be difficult however there are some key elements to consider. The first of which is to consider that most communication is non-verbal, and therefore it is crucial to be aware of both verbal and non-verbal cues both when listening and when presenting your own ideas. Another key element of effective communication is being open and empathetic towards the person or people who you are interacting with and avoid overly pressuring them. This open mindset fosters a space where ideas can be shared freely without the fear that ideas will get shut down, leading to a more diverse pool of ideas to compare and choose from. Lastly, being flexible is essential when it comes to effective communication, each person will have a unique idea of how a problem should be solved, and without some flexibility, a solution is not likely to be easy.
            <br><br>
            <u>Personal Experience Related to Communication</u><br>
            One example of a personal experience related to communication that stands out is my experience on an esports team. On this team of five, we always have different ideas about the best way to approach different situations and it can often lead to disagreements and poor decision making. I believe this could be improved by being more flexible and empathetic towards everyone and giving more thought to their ideas before making final decisions.
