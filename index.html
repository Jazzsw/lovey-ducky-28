                <br><br><u>What is the software development process?</u><br><br>
                The software development process is the process through which a client’s requirements are gathered,
                analyzed, and turned into a functional piece of software. It starts with the requirements-gathering
                stage, in which the software developer works closely with the client in order to create a list of
                requirements that the software must meet, as well as features that the client would like incorporated
                but are not necessarily required. This stage helps the developer understand the problem that their
                software is intended to solve. The next stage is the design stage, in which the developer, usually with
                a team, works to create a plan to meet all of the requirements gathered in the previous step of the
                process. This step includes using design documents to plan out all possible solutions and decide which
                one is the most effective. The final stage of the design process is implementation and testing, where
                the design team works to create a functional piece of software to deliver to the client. This stage
                includes rigorous testing to ensure the software meets all requirements laid out by the client.
                <br><br><br><u>Why is software design important?</u><br><br>
                Software design is important because it encompasses the entire development process, from client
                interaction to the planning of a solution to the creation of a piece of software. It is an essential
                aspect of computer science that is sometimes less talked about, yet arguably the gathering of
                requirements and planning of a program are as important, if not more, than the creation of the program
                itself. This is because, without a clear idea of what is required and a plan for how to achieve those
                requirements, the resulting program will be sloppy and will not properly solve the client’s problem.
                <br><br><br><u>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well
                    and explain why.</u><br><br>
                An example of software that I use daily that I believe was designed well is Visual Studio Code. VS Code
                is a code editor designed for Mac, Linux, and Windows. I believe it is designed extremely well, as it
                perfectly blends the fact that it is simple and easy to use with its customizability and powerful
                plugins. The user-friendly UI is simple, and navigation between pages is easy and streamlined. It has
                many customizable features that make it good for many different purposes. It is clearly designed with
                the needs of users in mind and continues to be one of my favorite pieces of software.

                <br><br><u>What is the requirements gathering stage?</u><br><br>
                The requirements-gathering stage is the first stage in the software design process. It involves being in
                close contact with the client about what they require from the product. The goal is to formulate a set
                of requirements based on the needs of the intended users. This stage often includes interviewing the
                client about the features that they expect and then taking that information and creating a clear list of
                requirements that can be used to create a functional program. The requirements-gathering stage is
                crucial because it lays out the entire basis for the rest of the software design process and provides a
                starting place for the formation of a product that meets all the client's needs.

                <br><br>-As a professional working for a software design firm, I want a program that is powerful enough
                to handle large-scale projects so that I can use this software for my work.
                <br><br>-As a beginner in programming, I want a UI that is intuitive and easy to navigate so that I do
                not get lost and confused by the software and so that I can focus on learning a new language.
                <br><br>-As a person who uses multiple programming languages, I want a program that is capable of easily
                swapping between languages so that I do not need to use different software for different languages.
                <br><br>-As an advanced programmer, I want built-in plugins to customize my experience so that I can
                make my workspace more advanced as my skills improve.

                <br><br><u>Elements of empathy.</u><br><br>
                Empathy is a topic that is important in many situations, and the design process is one such situation.
                The main focus of the chapter on empathy in Subject to Change is that empathy is a way of understanding
                consumers. This can be applied specifically to software design in various ways. In order to create good
                software, the designer or design team must deeply understand the user and their needs; otherwise, the
                software product will not be effective. The designer must take into consideration the aspects of empathy
                that are mentioned in the reading, namely knowing the feelings and thoughts of the user as well as the
                culture and context surrounding the product. Understanding all of these factors that go beyond the
                numbers allows the designer to grasp the more human side of behavior that is difficult to understand
                with only tests and statistics.
                <br><br><br><u>Old business models and their flaws, plus the elements of empathy they lack</u>
                <br><br>The Consumers Literally model<br>In this model, the consumer is seen as only a means to gain
                profit and not as an actual human being. This fosters a division between the designer and the user,
                which means that by definition there is a lack of empathy because there is no understanding of emotion,
                and therefore the resulting product is not tailored to the user's needs but rather to what will sell the
                most and gain the most profit.
                <br><br>The Sheep Model<br>In this model, the user is seen as something to be analyzed and manipulated
                accordingly. This means that often there is more focus on creating an idea of the product than actually
                creating a product based on what the user needs. This means that there is an inherent lack of empathy
                when a designer does not attempt to understand the client but rather learns how to manipulate them in
                order to make more profit.
                <br><br>The Human Factor Model<br>In this model, the client or consumer is analyzed to create a
                statistical profile based on how they behave. However, this assumes that humans are like computers,
                taking inputs and then outputing the most efficient output. This lacks empathy in the sense that one of
                the key aspects of empathy is to understand the emotion that drives humans to do what they do, and this
                model completely ignores that and reduces the user to their most likely actions.

                <u>Prototyping in Software design</u><br>
                Prototyping in Software design is a process through which the designers create preliminary plans for a
                product before features are finalized. Its main use is to verify the design’s functionality and purpose
                before the proposed features are implemented into the product. Prototyping plays a key role in the
                software design process because it helps teams work together to have a collective understanding of the
                key requirements and how each proposed feature will address those requirements. It is also very useful
                to identify and address potential issues in the design before resources are spent creating a faulty
                product. Prototyping can also allow developers to seek feedback from the client and or intended users
                through usability studies which gives a good idea of the intention behind the design without investing
                in making it fully functional.
                <br><br>
                <u>Three Benefits of Prototyping</u>
                First, it saves resources in the long term. Although it may seem as if prototyping is not important, or
                an unnecessary investment of resources, it actually saves time and money in the long run because fewer
                errors are made and therefore fewer resources are spent correcting those errors. Second, it is a way for
                teams to work together more effectively because prototypes can be used to communicate ideas between team
                members and create clarity around the intended function of aspects of the product. And finally, it
                engages potential users in order to gain feedback directly from the people who will end up using the
                product prior to creating the final version.
                <br><br>
                <u>Paper Prototyping</u>
                In paper prototyping, the main steps include: Determining typical tasks, where the developers determine
                how the product will be used by an everyday user. This step is followed by the actual design of
                different interfaces and functionalities using paper, which is in turn followed by conducting usability
                tests and adjusting aspects that require revision.

                <u>Communication in Software Design.</u><br>
                Communication is a very important aspect of the software design process, and it has many benefits that
                will result in a better overall product design. Likewise, inefficient communication risks wasting time
                and money on designs that do not meet the client’s expectations. Effective communication comes into play
                with both gathering requirements from the client as well as communicating within a team environment to
                create an effective solution for the given task.
                <br><br>
                <u>Key Elements of Effective Communication.</u><br>
                Effective communication can be difficult however there are some key elements to consider. The first of
                which is to consider that most communication is non-verbal, and therefore it is crucial to be aware of
                both verbal and non-verbal cues both when listening and when presenting your own ideas. Another key
                element of effective communication is being open and empathetic towards the person or people who you are
                interacting with and avoid overly pressuring them. This open mindset fosters a space where ideas can be
                shared freely without the fear that ideas will get shut down, leading to a more diverse pool of ideas to
                compare and choose from. Lastly, being flexible is essential when it comes to effective communication,
                each person will have a unique idea of how a problem should be solved, and without some flexibility, a
                solution is not likely to be easy.
                <br><br>
                <u>Personal Experience Related to Communication</u><br>
                One example of a personal experience related to communication that stands out is my experience on an
                esports team. On this team of five, we always have different ideas about the best way to approach
                different situations and it can often lead to disagreements and poor decision making. I believe this
                could be improved by being more flexible and empathetic towards everyone and giving more thought to
                their ideas before making final decisions.

                <u>Affordance and its importance in the context of software design.</u><br>
                Affordance, as it relates to software design, is how the user is intended to use a given software
                feature. When there is any sort of ambiguity around the intended use or uses of a particular feature,
                and the client or user is left to attempt to figure it out, it is easy for errors or unintended results
                to be produced leading to confusion and frustration. This is where affordance is helpful by providing a
                way to eliminate ambiguity and clarify the specific intended use of a given feature. This will in turn
                lead to less confusion and an overall more streamlined use of the software product. Affordances are
                especially important when there is a large number of users that will be attempting to use the software
                product because, with a larger user base, it is inevitable that there will be more cases where users are
                unsure about the intended use of particular features.
                <br><br>
                <u>Examples of Affordance that I have observed</u><br>
                One example of affordance that I have noticed is the greying out of buttons that the user is not
                supposed to or allowed to click. This is a simple affordance that avoids a lot of frustration on the
                user’s end. And avoids having to manage complaints from users.
                <br>
                Another use of affordance in software that I have noticed is the use of colours and icons to reduce
                ambiguity around the intended use of different functions. By making use of associations the user already
                has these affordances such as making warnings red or using icons to depict the use of a particular
                button or input.
                <br>
                Both of these show why affordance can have such a large impact on the usability of the software as a
                whole and improve the user experience.

                <u>The Ethical Implications of Dark Patterns. </u><br>
                The ethical implications of dark patterns are fairly obvious to see. These patterns are designed to
                deceive users in some way, whether it be hidden costs or discussed ads, by definition these patterns are
                designed to mislead the user. This obviously is not an ethical practice, as it can easily lead to
                harming the user in a multitude of ways. As well as violating the trust between user and developer.
                <br><br>
                <u>Deceptive Patterns and How They violate the ACM’s Code of Ethics.</u><br>
                The deceptive pattern of “Fake scarcity” is when the software is designed such that the user feels like
                there is a sense of scarcity and that they must act fast and often irrationally in order not to miss the
                opportunity. This sense of urgency that is created makes the user act without thinking and often leads
                them to spend money or disclose information that they would not have under ordinary circumstances. This
                clearly goes against section 1.3 of the AMC’s code of ethics “Be honest and trustworthy”. The act of
                deceiving users for some sort of personal gain is clearly not an honest practice that promotes trust
                between the user and the developer. Section 1.3 explicitly states that falsifying data and promoting
                misleading claims go against the code of ethics. This dishonesty directly leads to users making choices
                that they will likely regret and can potentially harm them, financially or otherwise.
