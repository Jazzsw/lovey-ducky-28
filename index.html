    <br><br><u>What is the software development process?</u><br><br>
    The software development process is the process through which a client’s requirements are gathered, analyzed, and turned into a functional piece of software. It starts with the requirements-gathering stage, in which the software developer works closely with the client in order to create a list of requirements that the software must meet, as well as features that the client would like incorporated but are not necessarily required. This stage helps the developer understand the problem that their software is intended to solve. The next stage is the design stage, in which the developer, usually with a team, works to create a plan to meet all of the requirements gathered in the previous step of the process. This step includes using design documents to plan out all possible solutions and decide which one is the most effective. The final stage of the design process is implementation and testing, where the design team works to create a functional piece of software to deliver to the client. This stage includes rigorous testing to ensure the software meets all requirements laid out by the client.
    <br><br><br><u>Why is software design important?</u><br><br>
    Software design is important because it encompasses the entire development process, from client interaction to the planning of a solution to the creation of a piece of software. It is an essential aspect of computer science that is sometimes less talked about, yet arguably the gathering of requirements and planning of a program are as important, if not more, than the creation of the program itself. This is because, without a clear idea of what is required and a plan for how to achieve those requirements, the resulting program will be sloppy and will not properly solve the client’s problem.
    <br><br><br><u>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why.</u><br><br>
    An example of software that I use daily that I believe was designed well is Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a code editor designed for Mac, Linux, and Windows. I believe it is designed extremely well, as it perfectly blends the fact that it is simple and easy to use with its customizability and powerful plugins. The user-friendly UI is simple, and navigation between pages is easy and streamlined. It has many customizable features that make it good for many different purposes. It is clearly designed with the needs of users in mind and continues to be one of my favorite pieces of software.
